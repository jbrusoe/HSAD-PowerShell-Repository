* SharedUserMigration.ps1
  * This is a file I wrote to set the X500 and SMTP addresses for the WVUM users who are migrating to the HSC email system. It's not designed to run as a scheduled task.
* Create-NewAccountManual.ps1
  * This is a file that I modified to allow manually creating and provisioning AD users. It was used by the project to move WVUM users to the HSC email system.
* Create-NewAccount-NoCSCForm.ps1
  * Added code to populate AD user's mailNickname and msExchHideFromAddressLists fields
* PowerShell 7.1
  * Previously, PowerShell Core (Versions 6 and 7) weren't able to run things such as the cmdlets from the AD module. This has recently changed, and I began to test running the HSC PS modules out on this version. Previously, we had to keep all code running on PowerShell 5.1.

### Misc
* Worked with WVUM to debug issues with several conflicting x500 addresses which prevented other proxy addresses from syncing for the shared user migration
* Finished creating resident mailboxes for FamMed/Anest/Optha/East migration
* Populated Feb 9 resident migration accounts with x500 and WVUM smtp address
* Populated Feb 10 resident migration accounts with x500 and WVUM smtp address
