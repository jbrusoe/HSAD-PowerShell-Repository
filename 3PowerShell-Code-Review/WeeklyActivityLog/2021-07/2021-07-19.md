## Weekly Activity Report: July 19 - July 23, 2021

### PowerShell
* Get-MailboxClutterStatusRandom.ps1
  * This file was written to update the database that records the mailbox clutter status of all O365 mailboxes. The problem is that Get-Clutter takes a very long time to run, and there over 34,000 mailboxes in the tenant. This implies that to sequentially loop through these files would take an impractical amount of time to go through. Therefore, mailboxes are chosen at random to be updated in the DB. Over time, this will ensure that all mailboxes are updated instead of just a much smaller number being routinely updated.
* Get-HSCMailboxClutterStatus
  * Began writing this function to help with the UpdateMailboxClutterDB.ps1 file. It will allow this functionality to become more generic and will be finished next week.
* Update-MailboxClutterDB.ps1
  * The purpose of this file is to ensure that only valid mailboxes are in the clutter DB. It adds ones that are new and removes ones that have been unlicensed.
  * Verified with Jeremy that this is the output that he was seeking.
  * Sent a copy of this code to Scott Phillips at Jeremy's request.
* Remove-ExchangeForwardingAddress.ps1
  * Jeremy pointed out an issue where some forwarding SMTP addresses weren't being removed correctly. This has now been corrected.
